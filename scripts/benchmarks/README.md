## Benchmark Model – Naive Forecast
**Objective -> Build a Naive Forecasting model where the predicted demand (weekly_order_qty) for a given SKU and week is just the demand from the previous week.**

Formula: Predicted Demand at t = Actual Demand at t-1

***(This model is a strong baseline in time series forecasting,  if advanced models can’t beat this-> got a red flag.)***
